## A web application that provdies a framework for visualizing who you are talking to.
At its core, we have a Google Map overlayed on a Ruby on Rails application framework. The site allows you to draw a region on the map and chat with MapChat users in that area. Once a conversation is created, you can later visualize which area on the map is associated with that conversation
